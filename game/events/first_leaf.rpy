## First Chapter

# VA = Voice Act

    'That\'s the only thing the book said.'

    'After the Author\'s Note came the onslaught of blank pages numbered
        manually on each lower left side.'

    # Show MC's face in dialogue

    mc "Seriously?"

    mc "Why call yourself an author if all you have for a masterpiece is a
        blank book?"

    # *sigh* VA

    'You sighed and scanned the leather cover of the book.'

    # CG BG: Show leather cover

    'It doesn\'t even have a title!'

    'It doesn\'t have weird gold decors engraved on it.'

    'The book looks old and worn out but intact. It doesn\'t have those printed
        numbers they place on library books.'

    'It was unusual because even books that are to be place in the archives or
        to be obsolete has them. Especially since you\'re in the library now.'

    'You found it in one of the shelves in the far back of the library while
        wondering how you can ease your boredom.'

    # CG BG: Dissolves to show book's back cover

    'On the book\'s back cover was a small pocket.'

    'Usually they are attached to library books to contain cards to keep track
        of who borrows them; instead it contained a tattered piece of thin
        cardboard with a faded ribbon on top and a feather. The one used for
        writing back in the old days.'

    mc 'Hmm, if there\'s a feather then maybe the book\'s wasn\'t for reading
        but for writing.'

    # CG BG: Show right hand holding the pen

    'You experimentally twisted the light pen between your fingers.'

    'It won\'t hurt to try, but a plume needs ink for you to be able to write.
        Apparently, even marker pen\'s refill ink will do.'

    # CG BG: Library Counter Desk

    'You approached the librarian\'s table and asked for the said ink.'

    'The librarian\'s grey eyebrows raised and eyes you suspiciously.'

    mc 'I-It\'s just for my reports.'

    'The grumpy old troll - you mean librian - rummaged through the drawers
        and huffed as she placed the small ink bottle on the desk.'

    'You gave a forced smile and awkwardly hurried off to the table where you
        left the book.'

    # CG BG: Library table reading section

    'You opened it and stared at the first blank page, thinking of what to write.'

    mc '. . .'

    mc 'Maybe writing on an old book is a bad idea after all.'

    'You always come to the library to read because going home is one of the
        things you want to avoid but you can\'t do that so delaying it is
        enough for now.'

    'The author also said it will give you heartache. You certainly didn\'t
        need any more of that.'

    'You have a dysfunctional family that can\'t even eat one meal together
        without scratching each other\s face.'

    'You don\'t have much friends and no love life to speak of.'

    'Woah! Some kind of girl you are. But really, what can a blank book do
        to give you a heartache?'

    'You carefully uncapped the plume and wrote:'

    mc '"I\'m so bored . . . so bored, it\'s scary."'

    mc 'Now, what else?'

    # *sigh* VA

    'You sighed and stared at the ceiling.'

    mc 'I\'m not really one for writing things. Sure I\'ve submitted essays
        to my teachers but that\'s different. Those are required.'
