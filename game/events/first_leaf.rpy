## First Chapter

# VA = Voice Act

label first_leaf:

    'That\'s the only thing the book said.'

    'After the Author\'s Note came the onslaught of blank pages numbered
        manually on each lower left side.'

    # Show MC's face in dialogue

    mc "Seriously?"

    mc "Why call yourself an author if all you have for a masterpiece is a
        blank book?"

    # *sigh* VA

    'You sighed and scanned the leather cover of the book.'

    # CG BG: Show leather cover

    'It doesn\'t even have a title!'

    'But it does have weird gold decors engraved on it.'

    'The book looks old and worn out but intact. It doesn\'t have those printed
        numbers they place on library books.'

    'It was unusual because even books that are to be placed in the archives or
        to be obsolete has them. Especially since you\'re in the library now.'

    'You found it in one of the shelves in the far back of the library while
        wondering how you can ease your boredom.'

    # CG BG: Dissolves to show book's back cover

    'On the book\'s back cover was a small pocket.'

    'Usually they are attached to library books to contain cards to keep track
        of who borrows them; instead it contained a tattered piece of thin
        cardboard with a faded ribbon on top and a feather. The one used for
        writing back in the old days.'

    mc 'Hmm, if there\'s a feather then maybe the book\'s wasn\'t for reading
        but for writing.'

    # CG BG: Show right hand holding the pen

    'You experimentally twisted the light pen between your fingers.'

    'It won\'t hurt to try, but a plume needs ink for you to be able to write.
        Apparently, even marker pen\'s refill ink will do.'

    # CG BG: Library Counter Desk

    'You approached the librarian\'s table and asked for the said ink.'

    'The librarian\'s grey eyebrows raised and eyes you suspiciously.'

    mc 'I-It\'s just for my reports.'

    'The grumpy old troll - you mean librian - rummaged through the drawers
        and huffed as she placed the small ink bottle on the desk.'

    'You gave a forced smile and awkwardly hurried off to the table where you
        left the book.'

    # CG BG: Library table reading section

    'You opened it and stared at the first blank page, thinking of what to write.'

    mc '. . .'

    mc 'Maybe writing on an old book is a bad idea after all.'

    'You always come to the library to read because going home is one of the
        things you want to avoid but you can\'t do that so delaying it is
        enough for now.'

    'The author also said it will give you heartache. You certainly didn\'t
        need any more of that.'

    'You have a dysfunctional family that can\'t even eat one meal together
        without scratching each other\s face.'

    'You don\'t have much friends and no love life to speak of.'

    'Woah! Some kind of girl you are. But really, what can a blank book do
        to give you a heartache?'

    'You carefully uncapped the plume and wrote:'

    mc '"I\'m so bored . . . so bored, it\'s scary."'

    mc 'Now, what else?'

    # *sigh* VA

    'You sighed and stared at the ceiling.'

    mc 'I\'m not really one for writing things. Sure, I\'ve submitted essays
        to my teachers but that\'s different. Those are required.'

    'When you looked back down, you read something you didn\'t write.'

    'It made you shriek loudly and made you stand forcefully, bumping the ink
        bottle in the process, spilling the black liquid on the pages.'

    # *shh* VA

    'You were then answered by many hushing sounds that made you cringe as you
        erect the ink bottle and try to wipe the ink splotches on the table
        and on the book.'

    'The book magically answered your first statement with:'

    # Should we add a VA for Travis?

    '???' '"Oh! It\'s a good thing you wrote to me then! I\'m a little bored
        as well!"'

    mc '. . . T-That\'s not normal! Not normal at all!'

    'You put aside the shock and disbelief for now as the other occupants of
        the library averted their eyes in an annoyed manner.'

    # mc ehem VA

    'Somehow, in between of being freaked out and embarassed, you managed to
        get annoyed as well.'

    '"Well sorry! It\'s not every day you encountered a talking book!", you thought.'

    'You wiped the table with pages you ripped from the back of your notebook.
        As you clean messily, you noticed some movement from the corner of your eye.'

    mc 'The ink on the pages!'

    'You had your eyes wide once more and tried to choke down a scream.
        The ink blotch is fading but not completely, it\'s starting to form words.'

    '???' '"I\'m sorry. I didn\'t mean to startle you. I thought you had known
        that I would answer."'

    mc 'Right! That\'s it! This is definitely just a product of my boredom.'

    mc 'There is NO way a book would answer! Much less feel sorry for startling me!'

    # sound effect: book thud!

    'You shut the book loudly after shoving the plume and tattered bookmark on
        the pages you wrote on. You earned yet another batch of glares but you
        couldn\'t care less.'

    'You carried the book to the shelf you got it from and shove it back there.'

    mc 'Okay.. this. never. happened.'

    'You went back to cleaning the table, though there wasn\'t much since most
        of the ink spilled on that darn book.'

    'You placed the last of the ink-stained notebook pages in the bin and looked
        at your hands that were now dirty as well.'

    'Well, it\'s the marker\'s ink so you don\'t expect it to be removed soon,
        no matter how much you wash your hands, so you decided to leave it be.'

    'Now that you\'ve calmed down a little, you decided to check the book once more.'

    'It\'s definitely just a trick of your eyes played on you. And this time,
        you tried to convince yourself that the message from the book can\'t be
        real. It\'s illogical!'

    'Without noticing, your feet already carried you to the aisle of the wicked
        book.'

    'You took a deep breath before pulling it out once more and opened it to
        where the bookmark and pen were.'

    'But as you thought... only your writing and ink blotch were there.'

    mc 'Silly me, there\'s no way that would happen!'

    'You examined the first page once more.'

    'The spill didn\'t spread through the pages. It was just the first page
        and the ink\'s already dried.'

    'As you look closer, your dirty thumb left marks on the pages.'

    'You stared in horror as the words you saw earlier reappeared on the page.'

    # book fall sfx

    'You dropped the book like you would drop something that burns you.'

    'Oddly, it stayed on page one. More words appeared:'

    '???' '"I thought I scared you away and you\'d never come back, but you did!
        Thank goodness!"'

    mc 'What are you?'

    'You said but it did not reply like before.'

    mc 'Write it, you idiot! It\'s a book, it won\'t be able to hear you!'

    'You scold yourself and with that, you shakily wrote:'

    mc '"What are you?"'

    'This time, the ink blotch appeared lighter as you write.'

    mc 'Oh, this is convenient! Now I won\'t need to ask the librarian for
        another bottle.'

    '???' '"That\'s rude! I\'m not a thing, you know."'

    mc 'Oh great! Now I\'ve offended a book!'

    '???' '"I may reside in a book but I\'m more or less a person."'

    '???' '"I am the master\'s companion!"'

    mc '"More or less a person... are you sure you\'re not cursed to be
        trapped in a book?"'

    'The book was still on the floor. You sat beside it, close enough to be
        able to write and far enough to run away in case something explosive happen.'

    'The words appeared one by one this time.'

    '???' '"Of course not! The master may be skilled with magic but she\'s not
        so cruel to curse someone! She\'s a bit of a lone wolf though."'

    # *chuckle* VA

    'You chuckled at the last statement. The book\'s master is a girl and a
        loner at that. The master reminds you somewhat of yourself.'

    mc '"So let me rephrase the question: Who are you?"'

    '???' '"I\'m Travis Montmorency."'

    tm '"That\'s what my master calls me. I\'m male by the way."'
